# Chemistry Catalyst

A chemistry multi-tool made for chem class and for fun

## What can I run this on and how?
You can run this on any device with a web browser by visiting [this link](https://chem-catalyst.herokuapp.com/). If you're on an Android device, and you're comfortable downloading a `.apk` file, download `app-release.apk` from the [releases page](https://github.com/IncPlusPlus/chemistry-catalyst/releases). Or to do less clicking, [here's](https://github.com/IncPlusPlus/chemistry-catalyst/releases/latest) the latest release and [here's](https://github.com/IncPlusPlus/chemistry-catalyst/releases/latest/download/app-release.apk) the latest APK.

Personally, I recommend using a mobile device because that's where it looks best. There's just too much unused space on a big screen and it makes my project look ugly ;-;

## How do I use it
Open the application (open the app if you've installed it, otherwise, go to the web link specified in the section above). Next, visit one of the tools that have been implemented so far by clicking on the "hamburger menu" icon at the top left. A navigation drawer will open. Click on one of the tool's names to go to that tool.

### The tools
This project sports a meager three tools. However, I'll argue that it really has six because the second and third tools have multiple ways to use them.
